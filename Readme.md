## TLDR

CSS file that avoids **class**.

### Use

Build `packages/styles`, will concatenate in `packages/dist`:

```bash

 $ yarn build:css

```

### Inspiration 💐

> Our requirements are more modest but at the same time more responsible:

> long period, but while we use them we expect them to fullfill their role and serve us perfectly, so perfectly that we can also derive aesthetic
> enjoyment from observing them in use.
